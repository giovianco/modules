Standard Package checklist
----

There are two tables in the checklist. The first is to provide a brief description of the project,
it's goals, collaborator name (if external), etc.  The second is the actual task checklist, with
three columns, a box to check, the tasks written in a yes/no form ( as in yes I did it, or no I 
didn’t ), and a space to make comments.  With Pier we marked several boxes with [ Comments ] in 
gray on tasks where we felt comments would be most appreciated as to convey pertinent information.
At the end of the section I left space to add a project special needs, e.g. if a project requires
phylogeny trees.  Tasks were written in a natural workflow order when we prepare a standard package
to avoid, for example, making the final CCF figure only to realise that the LOH or clonal status 
doesn’t match.
